# Water&Grow Farming Simulator

Keep in mind that things will most likely change in development but this is just the base idea of how the game is going to work/be played. As of right now, Nathaniel and I have not decided on an objective of the game, that will be something that most likely will come later in the development process, for now, the objective is simply to try and get the most money possible in the game. The mechanics of the game will be as follows. First of all, W, A, S, D will be the main controls for the player to move in the game as most people are used to that. When the player spawns, the player will be at their base/house where they will have an empty water bucket in their hand, it will have a set value of 0. The player will then have to go to a water source by their base and click E over it to fill their water bucket. The max value of the water bucket is still to be determined. Once the player’s water bucket is filled, they can go to the plots over beside their house. The plots will be labelled based on which plant they produce which will each have different rates of growth, as well as different amounts of money they give to the player. Once the player waters the plots, they will have to wait until the plants grow, and once they do, there will be an indicator over the plant that is grown so the player knows to collect the money from it. Players are essentially trying to get the most amount of money possible in the game. Once they collect the plants they need to refill their water bucket again so they can replant more plants. There will also be a day/night cycle that occurs in the background, to give the game more realism. One thing to note that this program will most likely not be able to do is to allow for the player to pick the seeds they want to plant at each plot, and they most likely won’t be able to add new plots. This is due to the fact that our days to complete this is limited, so it would be hard to achieve it in this timespan.
